             "<p>RateMDs is the most popular ‘doctor review’ platform in the world, with millions of monthly visitors. Since even healthcare depends on star-ratings these days, many patients actively select doctors based on RateMDs reviews.</p><p>Unfortunately, this has opened the door to the entire medical profession having their competence questioned by people who have no medical training themselves. Physicians with decades of education and experience can find themselves publicly accused of medical malpractice by patients who didn’t follow instructions, had unrealistic expectations, or may even be suffering from mental illness.</p><p>Without any system for verifying genuine patient experiences, and confidentiality laws preventing you from effectively defending yourself with details, unfair and inaccurate reviews are a cancer on your reputation and should be treated as such. The most effective cure for unfair reviews is fast, permanent removal.</p>"
