             "<p>Anyone who has searched online to help get organised for a big trip has turned to TripAdvisor at least once. It has proven an invaluable resource for consumers who need information regarding everything travel-related – from hotels, to flight information and activity recommendations.</p><p>The only catch for businesses? Managing reviews on this platform can get messy. If you’re a restaurateur, hotel operator or any type of business involved in making travellers’ experiences memorable, odds are you’ve been reviewed on TripAdvisor. With an average of 270 user contributions per minute, TripAdvisor is a behemoth.</p><p>It’s fantastic for building your reputation in the industry, but when harmful or fake reviews pop up, it becomes a thorn in your side. While TripAdvisor is a trailblazer as a source of user-generated content, its lack of formal user verification processes leads to trouble for businesses who have been hurt by negative reviews on the site.</p>"

             "<p>Platforms like TripAdvisor have asserted that their reviews are all “honest, real and trusted”, but this isn’t always the case. Much of the time, there is no real proof that the person submitting the review has genuinely interacted with your company. </p><p>Fake or unreasonable reviews wreak havoc on a company’s revenue by impacting new customer acquisition rates, turning away existing customers all the same. This is especially troubling because as long as TripAdvisor is considered a beacon of truth by site visitors, every false or negative review on the platform stands to threaten your business.</p><p>It’s fair to expect that patrons can air their views and opinions on a business publicly, but it’s unfair for businesses to be discouraged from taking action. Removify helps you rebalance the scales and make the online world a fairer place for your business to be.</p><p>With a dedicated team of content removal specialists at the ready, you can restore consumer trust with us. Every business deserves a chance at fair online representation, and yours is no exception.</p>"
