Unfortunately it’s also a breeding ground for disgruntled ex-employees, unhappy customers, fake accounts, and trolls. </p><p>And yet many people still trust everything they read on Facebook. The more high-profile the content, the more it’s believed. One fake company review or colourful comment by a ‘customer’ can attract negative attention from thousands of users – even with no basis in truth.</p><p>There’s almost no regulation or verification, anywhere on the platform, against slanderous or misleading content. There’s barely any accountability for those caught abusing the system, either. And when someone turns their attention towards attacking you or your business, there’s nothing you can do to stop them.</p>"

It’s easy to create fake accounts, but most malicious comments come from real people.</p><p>Common attacks are in the form of abusive comments or posts, offensive images, or grossly exaggerated company reviews. Determined attackers will create dedicated pages as smear campaigns or even trying to steal business. If any of this gains traction, it can be devastating for your reputation.</p><p>The biggest barrier to removing malicious content from Facebook… is Facebook itself. The platform hates censoring its users and has no system for assessing the truth of comments. Without expert guidance, your demands for removal will usually fall on deaf ears.</p>"
